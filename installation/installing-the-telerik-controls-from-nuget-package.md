# Installing the Telerik Controls from a NuGet Package



This article explains how to use the NuGet feed and packages provided by Telerik to get the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls in your project.

This feed is available as of Q3 2015 SP1 (ver. 2015.3.1111).

1. Create or load your WebForms project.

1. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for solution**.

1. Choose the **Online** / **Browse** list of packages (depending on your VS version).

1. Enter your Telerik credentials in the Windows Authentication dialog (e.g., user: *my.name@my.company.com* and password: *myPassPhraseForTelerikDotCom*).

	>tip You can enter your credentials only once by selecting the Remember my password checkbox.

## Downloading a NuGet Package

You can download a *.nupkg* file to [build a private feed](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/power-your-projects-with-telerik---now-with-the-convenience-of-nuget) for your company by following the steps below.

>important Such a feed must be private (i.e., not available to the general Internet) and the standard developer-seat [licensing model]({%slug introduction/licensing/license-agreement%}) applies (i.e., the developers working with the controls must have active licenses). If you have questions on the licensing scheme, send them to telerik-sales@progress.com.


1. Navigate to [Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).

1. Go to the [Downloads page of UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCAJAX).

1. Click on the *.nupkg* files you require (e.g., *Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Ajax.Net45.2016.3.1027.nupkg*) to download them. The file name is built in the following format: `Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Ajax.Net<.NET version of your project>.<Telerik controls version>.nupkg`.

1. Configure your server and projects to use the feed.

 
## Automated Builds

Often enough, you would want to set up Continuous Integration and/or Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines or builds for your project that uses the Telerik components. This is a valid scenario and the "one license per developer" license does not prevent you from doing so. The Telerik components are commercial software and as such can only be distributed through channels that are private and/or behind authentication.

There are a couple of common ways people implement CI/CD automated builds:

* You can put your own credentials (or the credentials of the license holder, depending on how your licenses are set up) in the nuget.config of the build machine/pipeline. In many cases, when doing so, they will even be encrypted when you add the Telerik feed source through the CLI. Alternatively, you can copy an encrypted version from your own local config if you have one and if plain text is an issue. You can read more about adding credentials via the NuGet.config in the following page: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file#packagesourcecredentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file#packagesourcecredentials).

* Creating a local folder (for example, on a shared network drive or other suitable location accessible by your builds and team) that holds the `.nupkg` files we provide (you can download them from your telerik.com account).

You must protect your credentials and ensure they are used only by you and not by other developers, according to the [license-per-developer policy](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-agreement/aspnet-ajax). For example, take your encrypted password from your local NuGet.config file and use it on the build PC. They can by such colleagues (like other developers, QAs, designers, front-end devs, DBAs and so on) for building and running a solution, provided they do not use the Telerik components to create functionality. Of course, you must ensure that such credentials or package sources are not available to the general public (for example, in public repositories). 

## Troubleshooting

### Error: The schema version of '<namespace>' is incompatible with version 2.0.30625.9003 of NuGet. Please upgrade NuGet to the latest version.
	
In R1 2018, the `nuget.exe` version we use was updated from `2.8` to `4.3`. This is the executable file used to generate and read the `.nupkg` files.

Due to this update, you may get the error below when using Visual Studio 2012 that uses the NuGet Package Manager version 2.0. The **solution is to upgrade the NuGet Package Manager to version 2.8**.

> The schema version of `'<namespace>'` is incompatible with version 2.0.30625.9003 of NuGet. Please upgrade NuGet to the latest version.


### Incorrect credentials and how to reenter them

The setup can get stuck in a circular reference problem if you enter incorrect credentials the first time.
In order to reset or edit the nuget feed credentials:

1. Close Visual Studio
1. Open Control Panel -> All Control Panel Items -> Credential Manager or simply press Win button and type Manage Windows Credentials and open the manager.
1. Look for VSCredentials_nuget.telerik.com -> remove or edit the password.
1. Open Visual Studio and try to access the nuget.telerik.com feed again.

### Error Unable to load the service index for source https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget

Make sure that the Telerik NuGet Feed is live at [https://status.telerik.com/](https://status.telerik.com/).
